# Rhythm Division
## Introduction
Rhythm division is part of my research on music rhythm. This graph could show the inner logic of rhythm, which is very important concept for music rhythm structural research in the future.
## Method
Music rhythm has hierarchical structure, which help human understand the inner logic of music.

The method will consider several points:
* The hierarchical structure based on prime numbers.
* Sub-division could break the large prime numbers into groups for structures easier to understand.
* Substitute could treat group of notes into one object.
### Notice
The division factor (denominators) can only contains one logic division line. For example:

In one group of division factors: `{x[0],x[1],...,x[i]}`, we will make sure all `x[i]/x[i-1]` are prime numbers. If meet large prime number, try to divided to break it down.
## Deficiency
This algorithm is currently doing mannuly. Automatic algrithm seems too difficult to search now.
